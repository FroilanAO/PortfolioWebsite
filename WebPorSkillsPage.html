                <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
                <ul class="skill-list">
                    <li><b>Programming Languages:</b> I am able to do basic Python and Java codes, and I am currently trying to learn and improve in using Javascript.</li>
                    <li><b>Database Management Systems:</b> My only experience in Database Management is in MySQL, and I am not confident in this field.</li>
                    <li><b>Web Development:</b> Currently my most comfortable skill is in HTML and CSS, and I'm looking forward to improving by learning and improving in PHP and Javascript.</li>
                    <li><b>Cloud Computing:</b> I know very little to Cloud Computing and only know Google Cloud as a part of this field.</li>

                <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
                <ul class="skill-list">
                    <li><b>Communication:</b> Communicating is where I'm consistently trying to improve as I am not much of an expressive person and tends to keep quiet. I try to be active and present in real-life situation.</li>
                    <li><b>Problem Solving:</b> I am comfortable and confident in my ability in critical thinking as it represents my desire and eagerness to learn and improve. I consider problem solving as the opportunity to creatively expess what I am capable of.</li>
                    <li><b>Teamwork:</b> I struggle to improve on teamwork as I have not been in a position to make a project within a group as I usually have only done it alone. But I look forward to work together with capable individual to learn and improve in collaboration and coordination with others.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Management:</b> Setting a mental deadline before the actually project deadline is what I usually do before doing a project. Prioritizing what I already started rather than juggling multiple projects in one setting, because I'm very much not on that level yet.</li>
                    <li><b>Emotional Intelligence:</b> I feel empathy to those who struggles to comprehend coding and I try my hardest to teach and learn. Confidence only comes after if my written code is correct</li>
